# Event Dates Calendar

Built in March 2021. A Node.js application to create a notepad TXT file calendar by combining a few elements: copying old data from a previous event dates TXT file and creating expiration events, birthdays events, deathdays events, and common events that repeat each day and each weekend / each second weekend. Another element is to import all the Jewish holidays and events from an online website, and finally, take static events to be included in the calendar. All these will be combined into one new event dates TXT file. Also included - A script to scan the unmarked tasks.

## Getting Started

Clone the application to your computer.
Steps to view the solution:
1. Open server application on IDE (I use VSCode).
2. In the terminal run: 'npm i'.
