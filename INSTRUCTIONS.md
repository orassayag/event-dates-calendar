## Instructions

===================
FAST & BASIC START.
===================
1. Open the project in IDE (Current to 18/02/2021 I'm using VSCode).
2. Open the following file in the src/settings/settings.js file.
3. Search for the first setting - 'YEAR' - And enter the relevant year for the new TXT file.
4. Search for setting 'SOURCE_PATH' - Select the path you want to scan.
5. Search for setting 'DIST_FILE_NAME' - Enter the name of the new TXT file.
6. If you want to scan for unmarked tasks - Run in the terminal: 'npm run scan'.
7. Next - Time to install the NPM packages. In the terminal run 'npm i'. It will install automatically all the required NPM packages.
8. In the terminal run 'npm start'. If everything goes well, you will start to see the console status line appear.
9. If you see any error - Need to check what's changed. Current to 18/02/2021, it works fine.
10. If you see the console status line but the 'Total' not progressing - Need to check what's wrong.
11. If no errors and the progress works OK, make sure to check on dist directory
    (Example: event-dates-2021.txt) That the TXT file was created successfully.
12. Successful running application on production should look like this:

/* cSpell:disable */
