## Instructions

===================
FAST & BASIC START.
===================
1. Open the project in IDE (Current to 18/02/2021 I'm using VSCode).
2. Open the following file in the 'src/settings/settings.js' directory.
3. Search for the first setting - 'YEAR' - And enter the relevant year for the new TXT file.
4. Search for the setting: 'SOURCE_PATH' - Select the path you want to scan.
5. Search for the setting: 'DIST_FILE_NAME' - Enter the name of the new TXT file.
6. If you want to scan for unmarked tasks - In the terminal run: 'npm run scan'.
7. Next - Time to install the NPM packages. In the terminal run: 'npm i'. It will install automatically all the required NPM packages.
8. In the terminal run: 'npm start'. If everything goes well, you will start to see the console status line appear.
9. If you see any error - Need to check what's changed. Current to 18/02/2021, it works fine.
10. If you see the console status line but the 'Total' not progressing - Need to check what's wrong.
11. If no errors and the progress works OK, make sure to check in the 'dist' directory
    (Example: 'event-dates-2021.txt') that the TXT file was created successfully.
12. Successful running application on production should look like this:

/* cSpell:disable */
